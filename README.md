There are over 50 millions of songs on Spotify, making it difficult for users to discover and curate songs into playlists. We often use playlists to set the mood for studying, exercising, partying, and relaxing. Having the right playlist to accompany our schedule has become a ritual for many millennials. Automatic playlist generators not only help us discover new songs, but also allow us to enjoy playlists with certain intent. In this project, we build a model to auto-generate playlists on Spotify. We first study ways to enrich our original data. We, then, use these features to build auto-playlist generator models that we have learned in class or outside. Finally, we compare the models' performance based on performance metrics formulated upon our model assumptions.
